            <h2>Why Prague?</h2>
            <h3>Prague, the City of a Hundred Spires</h3>
            <p>
              Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic and
              the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated on the Vltava river,
              Prague is home to about 1.4 million people. The city has a
              temperate oceanic climate, with relatively warm summers and chilly
              winters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central
              Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance
              and Baroque architectures. It was the capital of the Kingdom of
              Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably
              Charles IV (r. 1346–1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575–1611).
            </p>
            <p>
              It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and
              Austria-Hungary. The city played major roles in the Bohemian and
              the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years' War and in
              20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the
              World Wars and the post-war Communist era.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prague is home to a number of well-known cultural attractions,
              many of which survived the violence and destruction of
              20th-century Europe. Main attractions include Prague Castle,
              Charles Bridge, Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical
              clock, the Jewish Quarter, Petřín hill and Vyšehrad. Since 1992,
              the historic center of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list
              of World Heritage Sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city has more than ten major museums, along with numerous
              theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. An
              extensive modern public transportation system connects the city.
              It is home to a wide range of public and private schools,
              including Charles University in Prague, the oldest university in
              Central Europe.

                <h4>Kafka Museum</h4>
                <p>
                  Kafka Museum is rather small but it's a place you should visit
                  when in Prague. Enjoy the visit and learn more about Franz
                  Kafka.

                <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
                <p>
                  Franz Kafka has always been portraied as a depressed writer.
                  But there's so much more to his character. This museum helps
                  you understand him a bit better.

                  Werich Villa is an ideal place for those who want to breathe
                  in a bit of the Czech cultural heritage. And you can enjoy a
                  piece of cake when you're done with your visit.

                <h5>What I like about it:</h5>
                <p>
                  When you step into the building and begin your self-guided
                  tour, it's like you travel into the past. It's like nothing
                  changed and Jan Werich could come in any minute.

                  When you see pictures from Prague, you might often see Old
                  Town Square. So, it would be a pity if you left it out during
                  your visit.

                <p>
                  Even though it's super touristy, I like to visit this spot
                  once in a while. And in winter, you can enjoy some of the
                  prettiest Christmas markets here.
