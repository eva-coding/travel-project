            <h2>Why Prague?</h2>
            <h3>Prague, the City of a Hundred Spires</h3>
            <p>
              Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic and
              the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated on the Vltava river,
              Prague is home to about 1.4 million people. The city has a
              temperate oceanic climate, with relatively warm summers and chilly
              winters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central
              Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance
              and Baroque architectures. It was the capital of the Kingdom of
              Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably
              Charles IV (r. 1346–1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575–1611).
            </p>
            <p>
              It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and
              Austria-Hungary. The city played major roles in the Bohemian and
              the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years' War and in
              20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the
              World Wars and the post-war Communist era.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prague is home to a number of well-known cultural attractions,
              many of which survived the violence and destruction of
              20th-century Europe. Main attractions include Prague Castle,
              Charles Bridge, Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical
              clock, the Jewish Quarter, Petřín hill and Vyšehrad. Since 1992,
              the historic center of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list
              of World Heritage Sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city has more than ten major museums, along with numerous
              theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. An
              extensive modern public transportation system connects the city.
              It is home to a wide range of public and private schools,
              including Charles University in Prague, the oldest university in
              Central Europe.
